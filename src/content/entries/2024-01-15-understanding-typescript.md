TypeScript's type system is one of its most powerful features, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Today I want to dive into some of the more advanced aspects that I've found particularly useful.

## Union Types and Type Guards

One pattern I use frequently is combining union types with type guards:

```typescript
type Result<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string };

function processResult<T>(result: Result<T>) {
  if (result.success) {
    // TypeScript knows result.data exists here
    console.log(result.data);
  } else {
    // And knows result.error exists here
    console.error(result.error);
  }
}
```

## Conditional Types

Conditional types allow us to create type-level if statements. They're incredibly powerful for building flexible, reusable type utilities:

```typescript
type IsArray<T> = T extends any[] ? true : false;
type Test1 = IsArray<string[]>; // true
type Test2 = IsArray<number>; // false
```

These features have dramatically improved my code quality and developer experience. The ability to encode business logic at the type level means fewer runtime errors and better documentation through types themselves.
