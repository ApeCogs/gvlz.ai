After using various AI coding assistants for the past year, I've noticed a significant shift in how I approach problem-solving and code architecture. These tools have evolved from simple autocomplete to genuine pair programming partners.

## The Good

The productivity gains are undeniable. Boilerplate code that used to take minutes now appears in seconds. Regular expressions that would require multiple Stack Overflow visits are generated instantly. Unit tests practically write themselves.

## The Challenges

However, there's a hidden cost. I've caught myself accepting suggestions without fully understanding them, especially in unfamiliar languages or frameworks. The "suggestion momentum" is real - when the AI is on a roll generating code, it's tempting to keep accepting suggestions even when they're heading in the wrong direction.

## Finding Balance

The key I've found is treating AI assistants as junior developers with encyclopedic knowledge. They can implement almost anything, but you need to provide clear architecture and direction. They excel at:

- Implementing well-defined functions
- Writing tests for existing code
- Translating patterns between languages
- Explaining complex code sections

But they still struggle with:

- Understanding broader system context
- Making architectural decisions
- Recognizing when requirements are ambiguous
- Knowing when NOT to write code

## Looking Forward

As these tools continue to improve, I believe the role of developers will shift more toward system design, requirement analysis, and code review. The ability to write code will remain important, but the ability to think about systems and validate AI-generated solutions will become even more crucial.

The developers who thrive will be those who can effectively collaborate with AI - providing clear context, recognizing good suggestions from bad, and knowing when to take control versus when to let the AI lead.
