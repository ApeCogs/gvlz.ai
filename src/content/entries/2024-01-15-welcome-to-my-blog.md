Welcome to my new blog at gvlz.ai! This site is built with Astro and inspired by Simon Willison's excellent blog design.

I'll be writing about technology, programming, AI, and various thoughts and observations. The blog supports different content types including full articles, link posts, quotes, and short notes.

Stay tuned for more content!
