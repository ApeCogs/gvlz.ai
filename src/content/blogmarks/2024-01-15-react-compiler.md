The React team just announced the React Compiler, which automatically memoizes components and hooks without needing useMemo, useCallback, or memo. This is a game-changer for React performance optimization.

What's particularly interesting is that it works by analyzing your code at build time and automatically applying optimizations that developers would typically do manually. The compiler understands React's rules and can safely optimize re-renders without changing the behavior of your application.

This reminds me of how Svelte pioneered the compile-time optimization approach, but React's implementation maintains full backwards compatibility with existing codebases. No need to rewrite anything - just enable the compiler and get free performance improvements.
