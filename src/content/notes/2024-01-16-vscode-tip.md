Just discovered you can hold `Option+Shift` (Mac) or `Alt+Shift` (Windows) and drag to create multiple cursors in a rectangular selection. Perfect for editing columns of data or adding prefixes to multiple lines at once. 

Combined with `Cmd+D` for selecting next occurrence, this has completely changed how I refactor code.
